                    The goal of the tutoring is to help students overcome academic challenges and lead them to
                    autonomous or independent learning.
                </p>
                <p class="para p2">
                    It is a special kind of teaching that is different from the teaching performed by teachers, friends,
                    and parents. You offer students one-on-one attention, individualized explanation, and a chance to
                    ask as many question as they like (some of which they may not ask people they know) in a
                    nonjudgmental
                    atmosphere. But remember, the goal of overcoming academic challenges must be
                    realized by promoting academic independence in the tutee and not dependence on the tutor.
